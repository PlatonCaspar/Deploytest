# Requirements sheet for managing the components

Components can be created, it should however be not neccesary to name properties, just the values.
Every Component can be assigned a EXB number or a A5e number (if nothing is given, it will be assigned a EXB number.)

The following propoerties should be available:

+ Type (e.g. Transistor or resistor or coil)
+ value (e.g. value of resistance)
+ housing or size
+ (maybe it is possible to get pricing information from rs and or mouser but thats playing)
+ available stock
+ number of reservations
+ (maybe we will track the stock from the lab as well)
+ if there is an open order on this part
+ if it is in the stock or out somewhere
